/**
 * Final definition of pure function:
 * 1. We began with "a pure function needs to have a relationship between the input and the output" ❌ Not enough
 * 2. "Direct inputs an outputs" ❌ Not enough as we've seen that u can use outside variables as long as they're not changing
 * 3. "Every tim I call with the same input, it returns the same output" Better. Not enough
 */

/** The full definition:
 * A function call is pure if I can take the return value of the function, and replace the function call with the return
 */
